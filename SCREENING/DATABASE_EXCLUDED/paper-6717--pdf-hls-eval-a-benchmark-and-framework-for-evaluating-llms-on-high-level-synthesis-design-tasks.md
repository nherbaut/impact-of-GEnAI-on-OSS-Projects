  title: '[PDF] HLS-Eval: A Benchmark and Framework for Evaluating LLMs on High-Level Synthesis Design Tasks'
  authors: Stefan Abi-Karam, Cong Hao
  abstract: 'The rapid scaling of large language model (LLM) training and inference has accelerated their adoption in semiconductor
    design across academia and industry. Most prior works benchmark LLMs for design tasks involving hardware description languages
    (HDLs), primarily Verilog. Meanwhile, designers are increasingly using high-level synthesis (HLS) to develop domain-specific
    accelerators and other hardware systems. However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design
    tasks remain scarce.To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework
    for LLM-driven HLS design tasks. HLS-Eval focuses on evaluating two key high-level tasks: 1) generating HLS code from
    natural language descriptions, and 2) making HLS-specific code edits to existing HLS code, primarily targeting HW optimization
    and performance gains. To evaluate these tasks, we construct the HLS-Eval benchmark consisting of 94 unique designs as
    benchmark cases. These designs are drawn from a diverse mix of established community HLS benchmarks and novel sources.
    Using a semi-automated flow, we prepare each case to be "LLM-ready", supplemented with a natural language description
    and a corresponding testbench for C-simulation and HLS synthesis validation.Beyond the benchmark designs, HLS-Eval provides
    a framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs across various HLS design tasks. It features
    a parallel evaluation engine, seamless HLS tool interfaces for LLMs, and an abstraction to support different LLM interaction
    paradigms, all wrapped in a modular Python API. With HLS-Eval, users can rapidly prototype and evaluate new benchmark
    sources, HLS design tasks, and LLM methodologies, speeding up the research and development of new AI-driven HLS workflows.We
    demonstrate the utility of HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of popular open-source LLMs for HLS code generation and
    code editing tasks targeting Vitis HLS. Our evaluation assesses LLM-generated HLS code across four critical metrics: "parseability",
    "compilability", "runnability", and "synthesizability" — mirroring the iterative debugging and testing process of an HLS
    designer. Additionally, we provide pass@k metrics for common design tasks, establishing clear evaluation criteria, baselines,
    and the necessary infrastructure for others in the LLM hardware design community to build upon.We open-source our benchmark,
    framework, and evaluation results at https://github.com/sharc-lab/hls-eval.'
