  title: '[PDF] CudaForge: An Agent Framework with Hardware Feedback for CUDA Kernel Optimization'
  authors: Zijian Zhang, Rong Wang, Shiyang Li, Yuebo Luo, Mingyi Hong, Caiwen Ding
  abstract: 'Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI applications such as large-scale LLM training.
    However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for
    code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur
    high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free
    multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of
    human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback,
    and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively
    generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics.
    In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\% correctness
    of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
    models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench.Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization
    across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while
    maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and
    incurs about \$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \$
    5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
    and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at https://github.com/OptimAI-Lab/CudaForge'
