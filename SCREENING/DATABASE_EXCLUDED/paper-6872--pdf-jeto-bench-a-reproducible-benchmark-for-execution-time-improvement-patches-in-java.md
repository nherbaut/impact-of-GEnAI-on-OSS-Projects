  title: '[PDF] JETO-Bench: A Reproducible Benchmark for Execution Time Improvement Patches in Java'
  authors: Khashayar Etemadi, Zhendong Su
  abstract: 'Automated fixing of performance issues is gaining increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks of execution
    time improvement patches are fixed datasets that target Python, C++, or .NET and cannot be extended to new patches according
    to user-defined configurations. In this paper, we present JETO-Mine, the first configurable and reusable tool for automatically
    creating reproducible benchmarks of execution time improvement patches (ETIPs) in real-world Java projects. JETO-Mine
    employs a three-phase pipeline: a static analysis phase that crawls GitHub repositories and identifies ETIPs using user-defined
    filters and an LLM-based issue classifier, a dynamic analysis phase that wraps the identified ETIPs in Docker images for
    fully reproducible execution and performs statistical testing to find objective evidence of execution time improvement,
    and an evaluation harness that enables quantitative assessment of both generated patches and generated tests. Unlike existing
    benchmarks, JETO-Mine is designed as a reusable tool that allows researchers continuously collect new benchmarks with
    their own desired filters and statistical rigor levels. We use JETO-Mine to build JETO-Bench, a benchmark of 660 identified
    ETIPs and 91 manually verified executable ETIPs collected from 174 open-source Java repositories. To build JETO-Bench,
    JETO-Mine scans 11 years of open-source development history and nearly 1.8 million commits. We run OpenHands, a leading
    open-source coding agent, on the 91 manually verified executable ETIPs in JETO-Bench and find that it correctly fixes
    14.3% (13/91) of the issues, aligning with results reported by similar studies on other programming languages. Our results
    also reveal that open-source Java projects largely lack tests that demonstrate execution time improvements, presenting
    an opportunity for future research in test generation.'
