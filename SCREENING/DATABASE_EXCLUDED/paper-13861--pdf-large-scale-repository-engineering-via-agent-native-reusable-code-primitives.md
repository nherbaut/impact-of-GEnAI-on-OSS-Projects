  title: '[PDF] Large-scale Repository Engineering via Agent-Native Reusable Code Primitives'
  authors: Haibo Jin, Peng Kuang, Xucheng Yu, Jerry Wang, Dehao Wu, Haohan Wang
  abstract: Large language models equipped with development environments have moved code generation toward repository-scale
    construction, yet building complete repositories remains difficult because interacting modules, interfaces, configurations,
    tests, and dependencies must work together. We introduce Code Primitives, agent-native reusable executable components
    with interface contracts, dependency closures, validation tests, and provenance. Each primitive uses a resident LLM to
    assess relevance and adapt its implementation, interfaces, and dependencies to the target repository, and we organize
    1,424 validated primitives in CodeFace, a searchable library for repository construction. We introduce LEGO (Large-scale
    repository Engineering via aGent-native reusable cOde primitives), which activates task-relevant primitives, integrates
    their adapted implementations with task-specific code while resolving cross-component constraints, and revises the result
    against executed tests. To measure construction end to end, we build LEGO-REPO, a benchmark of 522 executable reconstruction
    tasks spanning seven software domains, 22 capability tracks, and five difficulty levels, scored against native test suites
    between an empty-package floor and original-source ceiling. The strongest of 13 evaluated backbones reaches a delivery
    score of 0.318 and scores zero on 41.0% of tasks; LEGO improves all 13 by 0.1474 on average and raises GPT-5.6-terra from
    0.3180 to 0.5134 (+61.4%). In controlled comparisons, adapted primitives outperform retrieved code supplied as context
    or vendored unchanged. The effect persists against independent repository agents, across three external benchmarks, and
    with a disjointly re-mined CodeFace; GPT-OSS-20B for adaptation and diagnosis retains 95.1% of the homogeneous score at
    24.0% lower cost.
